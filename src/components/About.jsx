          I am a recent graduate with a strong background in Economics, but my
          journey didn't stop there. Despite having no prior knowledge in web
          development, I found my passion in creating apps and websites to
          address real-world challenges faced by society.
          <br></br>
          Driven by a desire to make a meaningful impact, I delved into the
          world of web development. What started as a curiosity quickly turned
          into a passion as I discovered the power of technology to address
          societal issues. I am particularly interested in leveraging my skills
          to build solutions that tackle pressing challenges faced by
          communities.
        </p>
        <br></br>

        <p className="text-xl font-aria">
          My goal is to continue using my skills in web development to develop
          innovative solutions that address societal challenges and contribute
          to positive change. I am passionate about leveraging technology for
          social good and look forward to collaborating with like-minded
          individuals and organizations to make a difference.
          <br></br>I am always open to new opportunities, collaborations, and
          discussions. If you share my passion for using technology to create a
          better world, I would love to connect with you. Feel free to reach out
          via social media platforms.
